some hot corners i wanted on windows

all corners: nothing when left button is held because that means im trying to click and drag something (like a window)

top left: toggle alt tab menu  
scroll up- task view  
scroll down- alt tab

top right: nothing  
left click- nothing because X button is there  
right click- shortcut

bottom left: nothing (start menu)

bottom right: nothing (that preview desktop minimizing thing)
  
maybe someday i'll make it without ahk
