# Cool-Corners
some hot corners i wanted on windows

all corners: nothing when left button is held because that means im trying to click and drag something (like a window)

top left: shows alt tab menu
  scroll up- task view
  scroll down- alt tabs

top right: nothing
  left click- nothing because X button is there
  right click- move window menu (some other app)

bottom left: nothing (start menu)

bottom right: nothing (that preview desktop minimizing thing)
  
  
this was made a long time ago but i'm still using it (maybe some day i will rewrite it from scratch without ahk)

i'm just dumping projects to github right now
